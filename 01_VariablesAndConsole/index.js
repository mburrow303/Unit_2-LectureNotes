/*
We can create variables using 3 different keywords provided to us:
 1. var
 2. let
 3. const

 var: an older keyword used to define variables. It does run into issues with *scope* and *hoisting*, so it is not preferred however many older code bases will use it

 let: is the same as var, however it does not run into issues with *scope* or *hoisting*, which makes it a preferred keyword when defining variables.

 const: short for "constant". this functions the same as "let", however, the value of the variable cannot be changed after initialization.

 we **can** make a variable without a keyword, however it will run in to FAR more *scope* and *hoisting* issues than our other variables. Please do not do this :)

1. JavaScript keyword to denote the creation of a variable
2. The name of the variable, which is how we will refer to the value it is storing.

4. Initial value
